## Introduction

Project Nighthold is an *MMORPG* Framework for Legion 7.3.5 (26972) based on the uwow.biz core that was leaked in early 2020,
this core and code has passed hand to hand to much people, even greedy people sell it (something not correct because if
the base code is under GPL laws, you must share any change you make in it, thats the reason i can share it).

NightholdCore itself has been created from an old version of TrinityCore, and is a *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++.

TrinityCore is derived from *MaNGOS*, the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechanics and functionality.

NightholdCore development is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.

NightholdCore is Under GPL 3 License so is completly Open Source Code.

*P.D*: Thanks to the fact that im alone as a dev on the project, ill focus on more core fixing, scripting and merge changes,
so plz take in account only 1 dev cant advance so fast, when the project have more people involved ill start updating main db
and other big changes

## Goals

Our main goal is to create a public and free Emu, free of toxixity and focused on optimize the way to work,
focus totally on stability, gameplay and community.

Usually other projects constantly change things on the core and remake system leaving in disregard the
gameplay part, we want to be different

Sadly too much people work as dev but all alone, without a community to rely on and share knowledge.

We dont have fear to use code from other public projects or projects based on GNU or GPL Licenced Code,
always giving the thanks to the proper dev or team that made them.


## State

Soon we will put a link so you can see the current state of development of the emu and db.


## TODO

Plz visit our [ToDo](ToDo).


## Requirements

The software requirements for NightholdCore are very similar to the one from Old TrinityCore.
The main difference worth mentioning is that on Windows currently BOOST version 1.64 is required.

Software requirements will be posted soon on our wiki so all can access to it.


## Install

Detailed installation guides are available in the [wiki](https://) for
Windows, Linux and macOS.


## Data Files

This core has been optimized for DBC/vmap/map/mmaps files from UWoW and are not provided as part of this source code package, but we soon will
put a link to a repo that has the current files and we soon will fix the extractors so you can get them too manually.
